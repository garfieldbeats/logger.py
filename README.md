# logger.py
logger.py is a Python software that can get the geolocation and details of a IP address. You can get another IP address' details or your own. If you choose to get another IP address' details, then please create a tracking link from one of our partners you can find below. Many tracking software already give decent details about the IP address that was logged. However, our software uses multiple APIs to log geolocation, proxy or VPN detection, timezones, ZIP codes, and postcodes.
